This server is still under construction. This means that it may have to be restarted sometimes and that it's okay to mess around a little on your own as long as you're not bothering others. That doesn't mean you can cause issues for others though and if you do you **will** be warned/kicked or banned.

# RULES 

The following are some general guidelines and tips for things not to do, this doesn't mean that we can't warn or ban you for other reasons.
If you are purposely being disrespecful or are trying to annoy or offend players, you will get warned.
The most important rule is to be respecful of others, have fun together and to roleplay your character.
For this same reason, if you have a good idea for an event or situation that might be fun for the whole serveer but might be potentially against the rules, ask a superadmin for permission (and wait for the permission before doing it obviously) :).

* (DON'T MINIMOD)
While it is perfectly fine and even appreciated if you tell people how to do things in game, it's up to staff to do something about it if someone is breaking the rules. Use @message to inform staff if you believe someone is breaking the rules and it's negatively affecting your enjoyment of the game or if you have a question about something but don't enforce the rules yourself.

* (NO RDM)
Do not kill other players without a valid rp reason that fits with your current role.

* (NO RDA) 
Do not arrest people without them having broken a city law.

* (DON'T NLR) 
 if you die act like a new person. Don't take revenge and don't go back to the spot you died for at least a 3 minutes or until the raid/event that caused you to get killed has ended.

* (DON'T SELF SUPPLY)
As a gun dealer, your are not allowed to buy more than one gun for yourself.

* (DON'T LTAP)
Don't leave right after killing someone, getting mugged, getting a message from a staff member, getting called into a sit or other events that could cause negative actions to occur for you. If you have a **valid** reason for leaving, contact an admin first and give them the reason you have to leave and when you'll be back.

* (DON'T METAGAME)
Don't use outside information that you gained from outside gameplay ingame. Just because you know that someone is stealing a printer because they talked about it on Discord, doesn't mean your character does.

* (DON'T PROP BLOCK)
Do not block entry to any important area's in the game. E.g. doors to houses (exceptions in building rules), roads, PD, ATM's, etcetera.
Do not use props to prevent other people from moving.

* (DON'T PROP KILL)
Do not kill or purposely damage people with props.

* (DON'T PROP SPAM)
Don't spawn an excessive amount of props for no reason.

* (DON'T OVER MUG AND RAID)
Don't keep mugging or raiding the same person over and over. It's not fun.
Wait at least 15 minutes between mugs or raid of the same group and persons.

* (NO EXCESSIVE CURSING)
While it's okay to sometimes say things like fuck this, fuck it please do not excessively curse.
